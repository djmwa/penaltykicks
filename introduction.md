## Introduction
### Project Overview
This project explores the role and influence of penalty kicks in professional soccer. Drawing on data from several top-tier and second-tier leagues around the world, the analysis aims to quantify how penalty kicks affect match outcomes, league standings, and individual scoring achievements.

### Motivation
The idea for this project originated from an offhand remark during a soccer match: “Maybe penalty kicks should be worth half as much.” That casual comment lingered in my mind and sparked a deeper curiosity about the true value and impact of penalty kicks in the modern game. What began as a thought experiment has grown into a full-fledged data analysis project.

### Key Questions
This analysis seeks to answer several core questions:

- What is the relationship between penalty kicks (both awarded and converted) and game results, league rankings, and top scorer races?
- How does this relationship vary across different leagues and regions?
- How have the patterns and influence of penalty kicks evolved over time?
- Can penalty kick statistics serve as predictors for broader outcomes, such as a team’s season success or an individual player's awards?

### Project Deliverables
The results of this project will be presented in three distinct formats:

- **Code & Analysis:** Annotated code used in the data collection and analysis process, along with commentary explaining the methods and findings.
- **Discussion:** A narrative interpretation of the results, aimed at a general audience. This document will highlight key takeaways while minimizing technical jargon.
- **Reports:** Visually appealing presentations of the findings, designed for hypothetical stakeholders. These reports will focus on clarity and accessibility while retaining essential technical context when needed.

## Planning & Approach
### Audience
This project is intended to be accessible to anyone with a basic understanding of soccer. If you know that a penalty kick is a one-on-one shot against the goalkeeper from a designated spot, you have all the background needed. More technical or sport-specific concepts will be explained as necessary.

### Data Sources
I plan to collect data from regular-season matches in the following leagues:

- **Top-tier leagues:**
  - Premier League (England)
  - Ligue 1 (France)
  - Bundesliga (Germany)
  - Serie A (Italy)
  - La Liga (Spain)
  - Major League Soccer (USA)
  - Liga MX (Mexico)
- **Second-tier leagues:**
  - EFL Championship (England)
  - Ligue 2 (France)
  - Bundesliga (Germany)
  - Serie B (Italy)
  - Segunda División (Spain)

### Anticipated Challenges
The primary challenge will be acquiring comprehensive and consistent data. While top-division leagues are well-documented, lower-tier leagues may have less publicly available or granular data—particularly at the match level. This could limit the depth of analysis for certain leagues or time periods.
